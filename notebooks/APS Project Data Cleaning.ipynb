    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "The educational system faces challenges where students, particularly those below grade level, are not meeting academic standards. Research from Atlanta Public Schools (APS) shows that parental involvement is a critical factor in student achievement. However, many parents are not fully engaged, limiting student progress and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "To create a recommendation engine that analyzes student performance data and suggests personalized learning resources. By incorporating gamification, the system will incentivize parents to engage in their children's learning activities, ultimately improving student outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance:\n",
    "Research demonstrates that students with involved parents are more likely to succeed academically (APS, 2023). Through this project, we aim to provide actionable insights to parents and educators, fostering stronger family-school partnerships and helping students meet or exceed grade-level standards (Atlanta Public Schools).\n",

    "# Step 2: Analytic Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach to Solving the Problem:\n",
    "To solve this problem, the following analytical approach will be used:\n",
    "1. **Data Analysis**: We will analyze student performance metrics (e.g., scale scores, proficiency levels) to identify patterns and gaps in learning.\n",
    "2. **Recommendation System**: A machine learning-based recommendation system will be developed to suggest personalized resources (e.g., Khan Academy, iReady) based on individual student performance data.\n",
    "3. **Parental Engagement Analysis**: Additional insights will be drawn to explore the impact of parental engagement and how gamification can incentivize involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques to be Used:\n",
    "- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizing the data to understand overall trends.\n",
    "- **Classification Algorithms**: To predict which resources would benefit students based on their performance level.\n",
    "- **Gamification Logic**: To develop a reward system for parental involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Detailed Action Items:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Analysis of Student Performance:\n",
    "We will analyze the provided dataset to identify trends in student performance. Key metrics such as scale scores, proficiency levels, and learning gaps will be examined. The goal is to identify students or regions that fall below grade level and require intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools**: Python (`pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualizations)\n",
    "- **Output**: Visualizations and summary statistics showing areas where students are falling behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Building the Recommendation Engine:\n",
    "We will develop a recommendation engine that uses classification or regression techniques to predict which learning resources will benefit students based on their performance data. The engine will match students to personalized resources like Khan Academy or iReady.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools**: Python (`scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms)\n",
    "- **Output**: A predictive model that recommends learning resources for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Parental Engagement Analysis:\n",
    "We will analyze how parental involvement correlates with student performance. Using descriptive statistics and visualizations, we will identify schools or regions where parental involvement is low and explore how this correlates with student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools**: Python (`pandas` and `matplotlib` for statistical analysis and visualization)\n",
    "- **Output**: Insights on regions where increased parental involvement could have the greatest impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Gamification Strategy:\n",
    "We will design a gamification framework that incentivizes parental engagement. Parents will earn badges, rewards, and certificates for participating in recommended activities such as checking their child's academic progress or attending school meetings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tools**: Flowchart design or Python-based structure\n",
    "- **Output**: A clear framework for rewarding parent engagement using gamification techniques.\n",

    "# Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the problem of improving student performance and increasing parental engagement, we require specific data points that will help us analyze student performance and make personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Data Points Needed:\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**: These include scores such as Mean Scale Scores for English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, proficiency levels, and percentages of students performing below grade level. These metrics are essential for understanding how students are performing.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Parental Engagement**: Although we may not have direct data on parental engagement, proxies (such as engagement surveys or participation rates, if available) will help us understand the relationship between parental involvement and student performance.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Learning Resources**: External resources (e.g., Khan Academy, iReady) will be mapped to student performance levels. These resources will provide targeted interventions for students based on their learning needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose:\n",
    "The data points collected will allow us to:\n",
    "- **Assess Student Performance**: Identify students who are below grade level and may need additional resources.\n",
    "- **Tailor Learning Resources**: Match appropriate learning materials based on individual performance.\n",

    "# Data Cleaning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the steps taken to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. The dataset consists of multiple sheets, each corresponding to different grades. Key cleaning steps include handling missing values, converting data types, and removing unnecessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 & 2: inspect , Load and Restructure the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to load the Excel file and each of its sheets. Since the dataset contains multi-level headers (merged cells across rows 2 and 3), we combine the headers into a single row of meaningful column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we remove rows with missing values in key columns such as 'System Name', ensuring that only complete and relevant data is retained for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Handle Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we address missing values in the dataset. Specifically:\n",
    "- We replace placeholder values such as `--` with `NaN` to standardize the representation of missing data.\n",
    "- We drop rows with missing values in key performance columns (e.g., '% Below Grade Level', 'Mean Scale Score') to ensure the dataset is complete for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Convert Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable accurate analysis and visualization, we convert performance-related columns (e.g., percentages and scale scores) from strings to numeric data types. This ensures that calculations and statistical summaries can be performed correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Remove Unnecessary Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns with redundant or irrelevant information (such as those labeled 'Unnamed') are removed from the dataset to streamline the analysis. This helps ensure that only useful data remains, improving readability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The data cleaning process has been successfully completed, and the dataset is now ready for analysis. The cleaned dataset includes:\n",
    "- Correctly formatted column names.\n",
    "- Handled missing values.\n",
    "- Numeric data types for performance-related metrics.\n",
    "- Irrelevant columns have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cleaned sheet is stored in a dictionary and can be accessed as needed for analysis or further processing. The next step will involve summarizing trends, visualizing patterns, and building models based on the cleaned dataset.\n"
